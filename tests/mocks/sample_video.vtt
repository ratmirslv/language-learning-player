Last year the smoking tire went on the Bull Run

0:00:02.029 --> 0:00:06.410
Live Rally in the 2010 Ford SVT Raptor. I liked

0:00:06.420 --> 0:00:08.990
it so much, I bought one, and here it is.

0:00:09.000 --> 0:00:11.300
We’re going back to Bull Run this year, of course,

0:00:11.310 --> 0:00:13.600
to help from our friends at Black Magic, and we’re

0:00:13.610 --> 0:00:16.930
so serious about it, we got two Valentine 1 radar

0:00:16.940 --> 0:00:21.590
detectors. Oh yeah. So we’re all set up, and the

0:00:21.600 --> 0:00:23.780
reason we got two is because we’re going to be

0:00:23.790 --> 0:00:27.230
going a little bit faster. We got a 2011 Shelby

0:00:27.240 --> 0:00:32.270
GT500 with a 550 horsepower all aluminum V8. We are

0:00:32.280 --> 0:00:34.560
going to be right in the action bringing you guys

0:00:34.570 --> 0:00:37.650
a video every single day, live from the Bull Run

0:00:37.660 --> 0:00:41.350
Rally, July 9th to 16th. And the only place to

0:00:41.360 --> 0:00:45.040
watch it is on BlackMagicsShine.com or right here on the

0:00:45.050 --> 0:00:48.580
smoking tire. (upbeat music)
