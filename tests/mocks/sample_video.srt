00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,019
Last year the smoking tire went on the Bull Run

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:06,410
Live Rally in the 2010 Ford SVT Raptor. I liked

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,990
it so much, I bought one, and here it is.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,300
We’re going back to Bull Run this year, of course,

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,600
to help from our friends at Black Magic, and we’re

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,930
so serious about it, we got two Valentine 1 radar

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,590
detectors. Oh yeah. So we’re all set up, and the

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,780
reason we got two is because we’re going to be

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,230
going a little bit faster. We got a 2011 Shelby

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,270
GT500 with a 550 horsepower all aluminum V8. We are

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,560
going to be right in the action bringing you guys

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,650
a video every single day, live from the Bull Run

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,350
Rally, July 9th to 16th. And the only place to

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,040
watch it is on BlackMagicsShine.com or right here on the

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,580
smoking tire. (upbeat music)
