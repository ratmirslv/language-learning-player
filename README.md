## Motivation

When I started learning a foreign language, I did not find a service that would help me learn it. I wanted to watch educational courses and movies that were stored on my computer. As a result, I created a web application.

## Features

Language Learning Player offers a range of designed features with the language learner in mind:

- **Opening local files:** Opens local files that are stored on your computer.
- **Translation of a single word:** When you hover the mouse over the desired word, it is translated into the selected language.
- **Translation of the phrase:** When you click on the subtitle line, the entire phrase is translated. This helps to understand the translation in context.
- **Multi-language support (ISO 639):** Support for many languages to help people from different countries learn a foreign language.
